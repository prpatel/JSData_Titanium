By examining an existing software system, we'll see first hand how we can increase software modularity with minimal disruption. You'll walk away not just with a much deeper understanding of the benefits of modular software, but also a migration roadmap for refactoring existing applications to increase their modularity. In other words, you'll see how to get ready today for the application platform of tomorrow.",

Without the benefit of dependency injection and AOP, both Java and Javascript code can quickly become an unnavigable and untestable mess. \r\n\r\nWhere frameworks like Spring have helped us gain control over our Java code, Cujo.js similarly aims to give our Javascript code more structure and testability.",

Therefore, a laptop is required by all participants. If you do not have a laptop, then perhaps you have a friend with a laptop, is so, well, that would work too.  In order to participate in the Scala Koan endeavour, a few things are required:  \r\n\r\n- A laptop\r\n- A modern JDK installation. JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.7 will suffice. Remember that it should be a JDK and not a JRE!\r\n- Your JDK should be mapped properly to JAVA_HOME and your PATH variables.\r\n- An installation of your favorite IDE or editor. \r\n- An inquisitive mind.\r\n\r\nThe Scala Koans project will be distributed with your memory stick that you will receieve at the conference. What you will do is take the project and copy it to your laptop. You can also run the koans from the stick, although I prefer the hard drive route, since hard drives can't detach that easily. \r\n\r\nThe process of actually running the koans will be covered during the session. \r\n\r\nAt this time though before attending the koans session, you may want to take the opportunity to load some Scala Plugins onto your favorite IDE and Editor. Below is a list of resources that you can use to enhance your environment so that you can enjoy Scala syntax highlighting and other helpful tools like refactoring, debugging and analysis. \r\n\r\nEclipse - The Eclipse has an IDE plugin for Scala called aptly scala-ide.  All the information about the plugin can be found at http://scala-ide.org including an easy to follow along video located at http://scala-ide.org/docs/current-user-doc/gettingstarted/index.html\r\n\r\nIntelliJ - IntelliJ has a Scala plugin that can be found by going to Settings -> Plugins, clicking on 'Browse Repositories' button and searching for the 'Scala' plugin on the left. Right click on the 'Scala' and choose 'Install'.  IntelliJ will prompt you to restart the IDE, do so, and enjoy. \r\n\r\nNetBeans - Currently, Github user 'dcaoyuan' hosts a NetBeans Scala plugin at the address: https://github.com/dcaoyuan/nbscala.  I have not tried this out since the number of NetBeans users has shrunk in recent years.  If you are an avid NetBeans user, and wish to try it, you can let me know the results during the session.  There is additional information at: http://wiki.netbeans.org/Scala\r\n\r\nEmacs - Github user 'aemoncannon' has created 'ENSIME' (ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for Emacs) at the address and has a great following. https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime. I also am not familiar with the experience with this, if you are using ENSIME, be sure to let me know your experience.\r\n\r\nVIM - For VIM users I found the blog resource to be the goto in order to get syntax highlighting working well in VIM. http://lorenzod8n.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/getting-scala-syntax-hightlighting-to-work-in-vim/  It is simple and works and have been enjoying the syntax hightlighting for a while.\r\n\r\nThat is it.

It's about understanding that WYBIWYG (What you Build is What You Get). Decisions have consequences. You are free to design and implement whatever you like, but you need to understand the consequences of your choices.\r\n\r\nREST, as defined by Roy Fielding's thesis, is a collection of architectural constraints designed to yield certain properties in deployed systems. When you take shortcuts, you simply will not receive all the benefits of loose-coupling, evolvable, flexible, scalable systems. URLs are not enough. HTTP is not enough. To fully embrace the world of REST, you must understand Hypermedia. The good news is that you already do, you've apparently just forgotten.\r\n\r\nHere's the thing though. REST is not an endpoint, it is just a beginning. Come to this talk to hear how the story starts. We will take a deep dive into why the Web works, the implications for building Hypermedia-driven REST APIs and start to look at what this means in practice.",

Language, and therefore what we call things, isn't simply reflective of reality. It plays a constructive and interpretive role.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that our technologies force us to make choices about world views and pretend that things aren't changing constantly. This yields fragile systems and high impedance to change that cascades through our organizations. This translates to expensive, rigid and difficult to extend failure to give the business what they want.\r\n\r\nOur friend Tim Berners-Lee and his Happy W3C Merrymakers have given us a set of technologies to help us solve these problems though. We forget that the Web he designed was not the public Web, but one to solve integration needs for complex organizations like CERN. The HTML bit that we have gotten so excited about is but a small part of the vision. We will introduce RDF and SPARQL as enabling technologies. They do not necessarily replace what you already have, but they do make it possible to share information with people you've never talked to: Collaboration without Coordination.\r\n",

		"title": "Functional SOLID",
		"summary": "Robert Martin assembled the SOLID family of principles to provide a useful guide to help us create object-oriented software designs that were resilient in the face of change. In recent years, the need to write highly-concurrent software in order to leverage increasingly ubiquitous multicore architectures, as well as general interest in more effectively controlling complexity in large software designs, has driven a renewed interest in the functional programming paradigm. Given the apparent similarity in their goals, \"What is the intersection of SOLID with functional programming?\" is a natural question to ask.\r\n",
		"detail": "In this talk, we'll explore this intersection. We'll begin with a tour of the evolutionary patterns associated with enterprise software and programming paradigms, as well as take a look at the ongoing quest for best practices, the goal being to elucidate the motivation for examining this intersection of SOLID and functional programming. We'll then walk through each of the SOLID principles, examining them in their original object-oriented context, and looking at example problems and solutions using the Java language. Then for each principle, we'll examine its possible intersection with the functional programming paradigm, and explore the same problems and solutions using the Clojure language. We'll close by examining the transcendent qualities of the SOLID principles and how they can make any design simpler, regardless of the programming paradigm employed.\r\n",

		"title": "Programming with Immutability",
		"summary": "For much of the last two years I've delivered a two-part series at NFJS shows entitled \"Effective Java Reloaded.\" For all pracical purposes, it is an ala carte style rehash of the book Effective Java, written by Josh Bloch. One of my favorite parts of the discussion is of Item #15, which tells us to \"Minimize Mutability.\" If we turn this inside out, we're actually saying that we want to MAXIMIZE IMMUTABILITY. When we do this, we reap many benefits, such as code that is easier to reason about and that is inherently thread-safe. This can carry us a long way in the direction of program correctness and decreased complexity. However, when we start to program with immutability, several major questions arise.",
		"detail": "First, the necessity of using a separate object for each distinct value, never reusing, or \"mutating\" an object, can quickly cause performance concerns. These concerns are amplified when we're talking about large collections such as lists and maps. These problems are largely solved by what we call \"persistent data structures.\" Persistent data structures are collections from which we create new values, not by copying the entire data structure and apply changes, but by creating a new structure which contains our changes but points at the previous structure for those elements which have not changed. This allows us to work with data structures in a very performant way with respect to time and resource consumption. We'll examine persistent data structures, their associated algorithms, and implementations on the JVM such as those found in the TotallyLazy library.\r\n\r\nSecond, because all of an immutable object's state must be provided at the time of construction, the construction of large objects can become very tedious and error prone. We'll examine how the Builder pattern can be applied to ease the construction of large objects, and we'll examine Builder implementations in Java and Groovy.\r\n\r\nThird, we run into problems when we start to use frameworks that expect us to program in a mutable style. A prime example is Hibernate, which expects our persistent classes to follow the well-worn JavaBean convention, including a no argument constructor and getters and setters for each property. Such a class can never be mutable! So how do we program with frameworks such as Hibernate and yet still minimize mutability? The key is found in not letting frameworks dictate the way that you design your code. Just because the framework require something, don't let it force you to make the wrong decision. Use the framework as a tool to write your code, don't let your code be a tool of the framework. We'll examine strategies for doing exactly that.\r\n\r\nYou should come away from this talk better equipped to program in a way that minimizes mutability and maximizes immutability.",
